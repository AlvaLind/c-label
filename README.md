## Bugs

### Solved Bugs 

* The image path to the images in the section "As seen on instagram" did not work. Fixed this issue with the code below:

```
<div class="seen-on-ig">
            <div class="insta-box" aria-label="As Seen On Instagram">
                <img src="assets/images/green-bag.jpg" alt="Green crocheted bag in the snow">
                <img src="assets/images/blue-purple.jpg" alt="Blue and purple crocheted bag on model">
                <img src="assets/images/image7.jpg" alt="Green crocheted bag at a restaurant ">
                <img src="assets/images/image8.jpg" alt="Blue and Purple customised crocheted bag on model">
                <img src="assets/images/image6.jpg" alt="Orange crocheted bag in a beach setting">
                <img src="assets/images/image9.jpg" alt="Pink crocheted bag in the snow">
                <img src="assets/images/image-1.jpg" alt="Orange crocheted bag on model">
                <img src="assets/images/brown-bag.jpg" alt="Brown crocheted bag in the snow">
                <img src="assets/images/image5.jpg" alt="Blue crocheted bag">
            </div>
        </div>
```
* Misuse of the `<br>` tag in the HTML. I solved this by replacing the `<br>` with CSS padding instead.
